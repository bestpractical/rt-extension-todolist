NAME
    RT-Extension-TodoList

DESCRIPTION
    Add todo lists to tickets. Often a ticket will define a task that
    requires several repeatable steps. For example:

        'Deploy new server' = (
            Order server,
            Find rack space,
            Confirm power,
            Run networking,
            Assign IPs,
            Autoload base OS
        );

    Where the steps listed above will generally always be the same for the
    task of deploying a new server rack. This extension make tracking these
    tasks from one ticket simple by adding a todo list that can be used
    repeatedly on any ticket created for the queue.

CONFIGURATION
    To make a custom field a todo list custom field, create a new custom
    field of type "select multiple values". Once created there will be a
    checkbox option to make the custom field a todo list custom field, then
    you can apply the custom field by queue per usual.

    Each item in the list will be a todo list checkbox item and each custom
    field applied to the queue as a todo list custom field will be available
    to load as the tickets todo's.
