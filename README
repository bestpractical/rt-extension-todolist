NAME
    RT-Extension-TodoList

DESCRIPTION
    Add todo lists to tickets. Often a ticket will define a task that
    requires several repeatable steps. For example: Deploy new server -
    Order server - Find rack space - Confirm power - Run networking - Assign
    IPs - Autoload base OS Those steps may need to be repeated each time a
    new server is set up. One approach would be to create a linked
    depends-on or child ticket for each one. However, they may be always
    done by the same person (the ticket Owner) and may not other ticket
    details tracked separately. This feature will also be useful in RTIR
    where different incident types can display a different to do list, one
    for Malware, one for DDos, one for Phising Email, etc.

    To make a custom field a todo list custom field, create a new custom
    field of type "select multiple values". Once created there will be a
    checkbox option to make the custom field a todo list custom field, then
    you can apply the custom field by queue per usual.
